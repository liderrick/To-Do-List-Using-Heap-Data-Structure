# To-Do List Using Heap Data Structure

This program is a to-do list application coded in C. It uses a self-implemented heap data structure to keep tasks prioritized and sorted.

A set of skeleton files were provided to start (Assignment 5, Oregon State University, CS 261 - Spring 2017). The heap data structure and a majority portion of the to-do list application were implemented by self.

## Instructions
1. Run `make` to compile.
2. Run `toDo.exe` to run program.
